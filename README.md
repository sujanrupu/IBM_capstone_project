# IBM Capstone project

## Introduction
In this capstone, our goal is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of 62 million dollars, a significantly lower price than other providers, mainly due to the ability to reuse the first stage. Determining the first stage's landing success allows us to estimate launch costs, which could be valuable if another company intends to compete with SpaceX for rocket launches.

The project employs a range of methodologies, encompassing data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with data visualization and SQL, as well as creating interactive maps and dashboards. These approaches enable a comprehensive assessment of launch success factors and predictive model development.

## Objective

Our objective is to leverage data science tools and machine learning to predict with precision the probability of a successful first-stage rocket landing. This prediction will enable us to estimate launch costs accurately. Furthermore, we aim to gain deeper insights from the data through comprehensive data exploration.
